# TextFieldEffects

I fell in love with the text inputs effects in [this article](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/01/08/inspiration-text-input-effects/). As an exercise I decided to recreate as many of them as I can using Swift.

Currently it features the following effects from the article:

- [x] Kaede
- [x] Hoshi
- [ ] Jiro **(in development)**
- [ ] Isao **(in development)**
- [ ] Minoru **(in development)**

## How they look

## Installation

The easiest way to install this framework is via [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

```
github "raulriera/TextFieldEffects" ~> 0.1.0
```
